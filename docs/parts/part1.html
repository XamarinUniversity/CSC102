			Here you will implement a program to read the user's age. The age will arrive in your program as a
			string so you will need to convert it to an integer. Once the age is in integer format, you can
			use it in mathematical expressions. You will then convert the integer back to a string and display
			it to the user. The high-level goals for the exercise are listed below:
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Read user input.</li>
			<li>Convert a string to an integer.</li>
			<li>Convert an integer to a string.</li>
		</ul>

		<h1 id="steps">Steps</h1>

		<p>
			Below are the step-by-step instructions to implement the exercise.
		</p>

		<h2>Create a new Console application</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Start <strong>Visual Studio</strong>.
			</li>

			<li>
				Create a new <strong>Console Project</strong> using either the <strong>New Solution...</strong> link on the home screen
				or the <strong>File &gt; New &gt; Solution</strong> menu entry.
			</li>

			<li>
				Name the Project and Solution <strong>Parse</strong>. The word <em>parse</em> has several meanings in Computer Science.
				In this context, it is referring to the process of analyzing the input string and computing the corresponding integer
				value.
			</li>

			<li>
				Fill in the <strong>Location</strong> field with the name of the folder where you would like to store your work.
			</li>

			<li>
				Click <strong>OK</strong>.
			</li>
		</ol>

		<h2>Implement your program</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				The file <strong>Program.cs</strong> should already be open in the text editor. If it is not, open it
				by double-clicking on the filename in the Solution view.
			</li>

			<li>
				Please delete the <code>Console.WriteLine</code> line that Visual Studio generated inside <code>Main</code>.
			</li>

			<li>
				All your code will be written inside the curly braces that delimit <code>Main</code>.
				Position the cursor in the text-editor window on the line below the open-curly-brace for
				<code>Main</code>.
			</li>

			<li>
				Use <code>Console.Write</code> to print out a prompt to the user asking them to enter their
				age. Using <code>Console.Write</code> will leave the cursor on the same line as the prompt
				which should be a more intuitive experience for the user. Note that there is nothing wrong
				with using <code>Console.WriteLine</code> here instead, it is mainly personal preference
				about the way it looks to the user (if you have time, feel free to try using
				<code>Console.WriteLine</code> and see how it behaves).
			</li>

			<li>
				The <strong>Console</strong> window is text based so everything you read from it arrives as
				a string. There is no way to say "read an integer from the Console" you can only say "read
				a line from the Console and give it to me as a string". Use <code>Console.ReadLine</code>
				to read the user's age. Store the returned value in a <code>string</code> variable named
				<code>yourAge</code>.
			</li>

			<li>
				Converting a string to an integer would be a tedious process if you had to do it manually.
				For example, to convert the string <code>"457"</code> to the integer <code>457</code> you
				would need to figure out which digit was in the ones place, which digit was in the tens place,
				etc. Then you would compute <code>4 * 100 + 5 * 10 + 7</code>. Luckily, the standard library
				does this for you (see below). In your program, use the <code>Parse</code> method to convert
				the user's age from a string to an integer, then store the result in an <code>int</code>
				variable named <code>yourAgeAsInt</code>.
<pre class="prettyprint">
string s = 457;
int i = int.Parse(s);
</pre>
			</li>

			<li>
				[Optional] Now that you have the user's age as an integer, you can use it in mathematical
				expressions. Include a line in your program that adds <code>1</code> to the <code>yourAgeAsInt</code>
				variable. This operation could not be performed on the string value so it is good motivation
				for why conversions from string to integer are needed.
			</li>

			<li>
				Now you need to convert the integer back to a string and print it to the console.
				The code below shows how to do the conversion manually - this is the technique you
				should use here.
<pre class="prettyprint">
int i = 3;
string s = i.ToString();
</pre>

				Note that you may have already seen a shorter way to achieve this same goal by letting the
				<code>WriteLine</code> method automatically convert your data into strings (see below).
				Do not use this shorter technique here; please use the manual process (i.e. the
				<code>ToString</code> method shown above) to convert the integer into a string.
<pre class="prettyprint">
int i = 3;
Console.WriteLine("The value is {0}", i);
</pre>
				Once you have the age as a string, use <code>Console.WriteLine</code> to display it to the user.

			</li>

			<li>
				Run your program by clicking on the <strong>Run &gt; Start Without Debugging</strong> menu entry
				(recall that clicking on <strong>Start Without Debugging</strong> actual does three things: saves
				your work, builds your project, and runs your program).
				A Console window should appear on your screen and display the program output as shown below.
				<img class="indent-none" src="./res/images/Part1.Completed.png" alt="- - - - - - - - - MISSING IMAGE - - - - - - - - - -" />
			</li>

		</ol>

		<h1>Summary</h1>
		In this lab, you converted data between strings and numeric types. This core skill is useful beyond
		the <strong>Console</strong> project used here. For example, if your application had a Graphical
		User Interface, the user would likely enter their age into a text field which would return the value
		to you as a string; you would then need to convert the string to an integer just like you did in this
		exercise.
