		<h2>Duration</h2>
		<p>20 minutes</p>

		<h2 id="goals">Lab goals</h2>
		<p>
			Here you write a program called <strong>FizzBin</strong> to test the divisibility of the
			integers 1 to 100. You will need a loop to let you work through the integers one at a time.
			For each integer, you must test if it is divisible by 3, by 5, by both 3 and 5, or by
			neither of them. You must print out a different message based on the results of your tests:

			<ul>
				<li>"FizzBin!" if the value is divisible by both 3 and 5</li>
				<li>"Fizz" if the value is divisible by 3 but not 5</li>
				<li>"Bin" if the value is divisible by 5 but not 3</li>
				<li>The value itself if it is not divisible by either 3 or 5</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<p>
			Below is the output from the finished application (output shown for the first 20 integers only).

			The high-level goals for the exercise are listed below:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Code a <code>for</code> loop</li>
			<li>Determine if an integer is evenly divisible</li>
			<li>Code nested <code>if</code> statements</li>
			<li>Use the logical-and operator <code>&amp;&amp;</code></li>
		</ul>

		<h1 id="steps">Steps</h1>

		<p>
			Below are the step-by-step instructions to implement the exercise.
		</p>

		<h2>Create a new Console application</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Start <strong>Visual Studio</strong>.
			</li>

			<li>
				Create a new <strong>Console Project</strong> using either the <strong>New Solution...</strong> link on the home screen
				or the <strong>File &gt; New &gt; Solution</strong> menu entry.
			</li>

			<li>
				Name the Project and Solution <strong>FizzBin</strong>. The name <strong>FizzBin</strong> is a reference to a
				fictional card game; however, the program you will write here is unrelated to the card game.
			</li>

			<li>
				Fill in the <strong>Location</strong> field with the name of the folder where you would like to store your work.
			</li>

			<li>
				Click <strong>OK</strong>.
			</li>
		</ol>

		<h2>Implement your program</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				The file <strong>Program.cs</strong> should already be open in the text editor. If it is not, open it
				by double-clicking on the filename in the Solution view.
			</li>

			<li>
				Please delete the <code>Console.WriteLine</code> line that Visual Studio generated inside <code>Main</code>.
			</li>

			<li>
				All your code will be written inside the curly braces that delimit <code>Main</code>.
				Position the cursor in the text-editor window on the line below the open-curly-brace for
				<code>Main</code>.
			</li>

			<li>
				Add a loop that will run 100 times to your program. Either a <code>for</code> loop
				or a <code>while</code> will work for this; however, most programmers would use
				a <code>for</code> loop because you have a fixed number of iterations and the
				stop-condition is simple. The syntax is shown below; this loop will run 5 times
				with values of <code>i</code> equal to 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
<pre class="prettyprint">
for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++)
{
  // loop 'body' goes here, i.e. the work to do each time
}
</pre>
				Note that there is nothing special about the use of <code>i</code> as the variable
				name inside the loop. However, it is a convention that has been around for many years
				in programming so you should probably follow it unless you have a good reason to
				use a different name. There is some debate over the origin of <code>i</code> as the
				loop variable. Many people think it comes from math where the letters <code>i</code>
				and <code>j</code> are often used as subscripts. Others think it is shorthand for the
				word <code>index</code>.
			</li>

			<li>
				Inside your loop, add a series of <code>if-else</code> statements to determine if <code>i</code>
				is divisible by 3, by 5, by both 3 and 5, or neither. Here are the messages to print in each
				of the four cases:

				<ul>
					<li>"FizzBin!" if the value is divisible by both 3 and 5</li>
					<li>"Fizz" if the value is divisible by 3 but not 5</li>
					<li>"Bin" if the value is divisible by 5 but not 3</li>
					<li>The value itself if it is not divisible by either 3 or 5</li>
				</ul>

				The code below shows a sample <code>if</code> statement that tests divisibility. 
				Note the use of logical-and <code>&amp;&amp;</code> to combine two tests together.
				"And" means that both tests must be true for the entire test to be true (there is
				also a logical-or operator <code>||</code> but you will not need it for this program).
<pre class="prettyprint">
if (i % 2 == 0 && i % 4 == 0) // test if i is divisible by both 2 and 4
{
  // ...
}
</pre>
			</li>

			<li>
				Run your program by clicking on the <strong>Run &gt; Start Without Debugging</strong> menu entry
				(recall that clicking on <strong>Start Without Debugging</strong> actual does three things: saves
				your work, builds your project, and runs your program).
				A Console window should appear on your screen and display the program output as shown below.
				The output will be larger than the Console can show so you will need to use the scroll bar to
				see everything.

			</li>

		</ol>

		<h1>Summary</h1>
		This exercise explored the <code>for</code> loop and the <code>if</code> statement. These are core
		building blocks for controlling the execution of your programs: <code>if</code> statements let you
		react to different conditions and loops allow you to easily process large collections of data.
		It is likely that you will find them useful in every nontrivial program you develop.
